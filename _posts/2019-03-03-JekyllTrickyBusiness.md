I started to use Jekyll yesterday to host my blog. One thing that tricked me was the files in the _site folder are not supposed to be edited. I made some changes trying to update some footer and adding some stuff but my changes kept being wiped away. I wish I knew this earlier. :-)

Other than that, so far so good!
