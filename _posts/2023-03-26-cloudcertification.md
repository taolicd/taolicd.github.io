Starting from Nov 2022, I decided to upskill in the cloud space. I want to share experience, resources I have gathered  and  tips I have learned with anybody who is interested in getting  cloud certified. 

## Background required  to get cloud certifed 

You don't need much prior knowledge to start your cloud certification. You don't need to know any programming language.
