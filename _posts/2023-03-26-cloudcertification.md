Starting from Nov 2022, I decided to get certified in AWS. This blog shares my experience, resources I have gathered, and tips I have learned during my cloud certification journey. 

## Background required to get started with cloud certification

You don't need any prior knowledge to get started. You don't need to know any programming language. If you have some web technology knowledge such as understanding HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and SSH, that is a plus. Even if you have no prior IT or web tech knowledge, as long as you are willing to learn and spend enough time and effort, you can get an entry level certification such as [Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) in one month. 


## Which cloud certification to start with

The most popular cloud solutions are: (Statistics from [this post](https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cloud-computing-statistics/) as of March 2023)

1. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) with about 33% market share
2. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with about 23% market share
3. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) with about 11% market share

 As far as I know, GCP is still [not profitable](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/will-google-cloud-ever-be-profitable/2023/02/) even though Google has invested in it [since 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform). Probably I would want to skip GCP and consider either AWS or Azure. 

For AWS, the most popular and widely accepted certificate is [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/). As of March 2023, AWS provides [12 certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/?nc2=sb_ce_exm). You don't need to take the exams in any specific order. 

For Microsoft, the most popular certificate is [Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/).

This post focuses on AWS. In general, it is better to stick with one company's solution (either AWS or Azure) and get an in-depth understanding before moving on to another solution. 

## How much does it cost?

You need to budget two types of cost: 

* You need to pay a fee to register for cloud certification exams. For AWS, the exam costs from 100 up to 300 dollars depending on which certification you want. 

* Many free resources are available especially for entry level certifications. You may choose to buy online courses, which may cost from 10 dollars to hundreds of dollars. I will share more details on the choices in the Resources section below.

## Resources 

This post focuses on the entry level AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate and the most popular mid level AWS Solution Architect Associate certificate.

### Cloud Practitioner

### AWS Solution Architect Associate 



## AWS specific tips 

* After passing an exam, you will get a 50% off discount code for your next exam. For people who are new in cloud computing, my suggestion is to start with the $100 entry-level Solution Cloud Practitioner exam, which is much easier to pass than the $150 dollar Architect Associate exam. After you pass the Cloud Practitioner exam, you will get a half price off for the Architect Associate exam. This approach boosts your confidence and only costs you $25 extra dollars. Some people who already have AWS experience may choose to skip Cloud Practitioner and directly tackle the Solution Architect Associate level, which is also allowed.  
  
* If English is not your native language, when you register the exam, you can [request to get extra 30 minutes](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/) for the exam. 
  
* You can choose to take the online AWS certification exam at home with a proctor monitoring you remotely or go to a test center. I did two tests at home and both times things went well. Find a quiet place in your room and do the preparation requirements ahead of the time.
