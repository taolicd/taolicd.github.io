Starting from Nov 2022, I took an interest in upskilling in the cloud space. A friend is asking me to share tips and thoughts on getting cloud certified. I have gathered these my experiences and resources through this journey.

## What background do I need to have to start my cloud certification 

You don't need much prior knowledge to start your cloud certification. You don't need to know any programming language. If you have some basic web technology knowledge such as understanding HTTP, IP, SSH, your journey will be a bit easier. Even if you have no prior web tech knowledge at all, as long as you are willing to learn, you can start from the beginning and get an entry level certification in one month. 

## How much does it cost?



## Which cloud certification to start with

The most popular cloud solutions are:

1. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) with about 33% market share
2. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with about 23% market share
3. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) with about 11% market share

(Statistics from https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cloud-computing-statistics/ as of March 2023)

If I were to choose, I'd go with either 1 AWS or 2 Microsoft and skip 3 from Google. As far as I know, GCP is still not profitable after Google has invested in it for so many years. 

For AWS, the most popular certificate is [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).

For Microsoft, the most popular certificate is [Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/)
