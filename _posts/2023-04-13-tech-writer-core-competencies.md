I asked the following question to ChatGPT 4, Claude, and Bard and here are the answers. 

## Prompt 

Describe the core competencies of a technical writer in the age of generative AI. 

## ChatGPT 4

In the age of generative AI, the role of a technical writer has evolved to complement AI capabilities. Core competencies include:

1. **AI collaboration**: Effectively using AI tools to streamline writing, editing, and research tasks, while also recognizing the limitations of AI and knowing when human intervention is required.

2. **Critical thinking**: Evaluating information from various sources, including AI-generated content, to ensure accuracy, relevance, and reliability.

3. **Adaptability**: Staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and adapting writing strategies to best leverage new tools and capabilities.

4. **Audience analysis**: Identifying target audiences and tailoring content to meet their specific needs, preferences, and levels of technical understanding.

5. **Information architecture**: Organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly manner that facilitates easy navigation and comprehension.

6. **Visual communication**: Designing and incorporating visuals, such as diagrams, charts, and infographics, to enhance understanding and retention of complex technical concepts.

7. **Revision and editing**: Refining and polishing content to ensure clarity, coherence, and consistency in language, style, and tone, while maintaining a focus on usability.

8. **Project management**: Coordinating with cross-functional teams, managing deadlines, and efficiently allocating resources to ensure timely delivery of high-quality documentation.

9. **Ethics and legal compliance**: Adhering to ethical principles, such as intellectual property rights, privacy, and accessibility, while also ensuring compliance with industry-specific laws and regulations.

10. **Communication**: Effectively communicating with subject matter experts, team members, and stakeholders to gather information, address concerns, and solicit feedback throughout the documentation process.

Technical writers in the age of generative AI must be able to harness the power of AI tools while maintaining the human touch needed to create clear, concise, and engaging content that meets the needs of diverse audiences.

## Claude 

Here are the core competencies I would identify for a technical writer in the age of generative AI and automation:

• Strong writing and communication skills. While AI can generate drafts, human writers are still needed to craft clear, concise, and compelling content. Technical writers need to have a mastery of language and the ability to communicate complex ideas.

• Subject matter expertise. Technical writers need to have a deep understanding of the products, services, tools, systems, etc. they are documenting. AI cannot match the knowledge and expertise of an experienced technical writer. 

• Information architecture and content design skills. Technical writers need to be able to structure and organize information in a logical, intuitive, and user-friendly way. Determining the right content and optimal structure for a given audience and purpose requires human judgment.

• Adaptability and willingness to learn. Technologies like generative AI are emerging and evolving rapidly. Technical writers need to stay up-to-date with new tools and be willing to adapt their processes and skills. Curiosity and a growth mindset are important.

• Creativity. While AI can generate templates and samples, crafting truly engaging and impactful content requires human creativity, judgment, and an artistic sensibility. Technical writers need to tap into their creativity.

• Collaborative mindset. Technical writers work with subject matter experts, designers, product managers, and others. They need to be able to collaborate, communicate, provide feedback, and incorporate input from stakeholders. Strong interpersonal skills are key.

• Understanding of new technologies. Technical writers do not necessarily need to have advanced coding or technical skills but they do need to have a basic understanding of emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, chatbots, and more. This allows them to be effective partners and helps future-proof their role.

In summary, technical writers working with AI need a blend of both technical and human-centered soft skills. AI will likely transform the role of the technical writer but human writers will still be critical to the content development process. Technical writing is a job that machines may enhance but likely cannot fully replace.

## Bard

The core competency of a technical writer in the age of generative AI is the ability to understand and use generative AI tools to create high-quality, user-friendly technical documentation. This includes the ability to:
