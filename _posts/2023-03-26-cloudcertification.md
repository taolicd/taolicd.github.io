Starting from Nov 2022, I decided to get certified in AWS. This blog shares my experience, resources I have gathered, and tips I have learned during my cloud certification journey. 

## Background required to get started with cloud certification

You don't need any prior knowledge to get started. You don't need to know any programming language. If you have some basic IT or web technology knowledge such as understanding HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and SSH, that is a plus. Even if you have no prior IT knowledge, as long as you are willing to learn and spend enough time and effort, you can pass an entry level certification such as [Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) in one month. 


## Which cloud certification to start with

The most popular cloud solutions are (statistics from [this post](https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cloud-computing-statistics/) as of March 2023):

1. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) with about 33% market share
2. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with about 23% market share
3. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) with about 11% market share

 As far as I know, GCP is still [not profitable](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/will-google-cloud-ever-be-profitable/2023/02/) even though Google has invested in it [since 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform). Probably I would want to skip GCP and focus on AWS or Azure. 

For AWS, the most popular and widely accepted certificate is [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/). As of March 2023, AWS provides [12 certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/?nc2=sb_ce_exm). 

For Microsoft, the most popular certificate is [Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/).

This post focuses on AWS. In general, it is better to stick with one company's solution and get an in-depth understanding before moving on to another company's solution. 

## How much does it cost and where to find the study materials

You need to budget two types of cost: 

* You pay a fee to register for cloud certification exams. For AWS, the exams cost 100 for entry level, 150 for mid level, and 300 for pro level. The good news after you pass one exam, you get a 50% off discount code for the next exam. 

* Many free resources are available especially for entry and mid level exams. You may choose to buy online courses, which may cost from 10 dollars to hundreds of dollars. I will share details on the study resources below.

## AWS certification tips 

* For people who are new with AWS, my suggestion is to start with the $100 entry-level Solution Cloud Practitioner exam, which is much easier to pass than the $150 dollar Solution Architect Associate exam. After you pass the Cloud Practitioner exam, you get a 50% off for the Architect Associate exam. This approach boosts your confidence. Compared with the approach to directly tackle the Solution Architect Associate, you only pay $25 extra and you get one more certificate. 
  
* If English is not your native language, when you register the exam, you can [request to get extra 30 minutes](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/) for the exam. 
  
* You can choose to take the AWS certification exam at home with a proctor monitoring you remotely or go to a test center. I did both [my Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/5bd9a734-b3fa-4563-bd1a-3d7f3270d012/) and [Solution Architect Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/f4c482ea-c4a9-4c59-8800-b082b8ff2758/) tests at home and both went well. Find a quiet place in your house and do the preparation requirements ahead of the time. 

* AWS certification runs different types of promotions throughout the year. For example, currently t here is a promotion on [free retake before May 31](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/Amazon-Web-Services/free-retake.aspx).
